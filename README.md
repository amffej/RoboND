# Search and Sample Return Project


![alt text][image_0] 

The main objective of this project is to program a rover to autonomously navigate and perform various tasks in a simulated environment built with the Unity game engine. This project is modeled after the [NASA sample return challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html) with the goal to provide firsthand experience with the three essential elements of robotics, which are perception, decision making and actuation. 

Autonomous navigation and object detection is achieved by using thresholding techniques which allow us to identify the navigable regions and obstacles in each image. Thresholding is a technique that replaces each pixel in an image with its binary representation if its intensity is within a given threshold.
